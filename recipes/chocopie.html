            <h2>Steps:</h2>
                <ol>
                 <h4><em>For The Crust:</em></h4>
                    <li>Pulse the flour, salt, sugar, and butter together until the butter is pea-sized.</li>
                    <li>Add the buttermilk and continue to pulse about 8 times.</li>
                    <li>Once the flour sticks to itself when squeezed together, dump out dough onto a floured surface, and work it together into a disk.</li>
                    <li>If the dough is too dry, add more buttermilk or water 1 tablespoon at a time.</li>
                    <li>Cover with plastic wrap. Place in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Roll out the dough on a floured work surface into a 12-inch round. </li>
                    <li>Gently place into an 8-inch pie pan. Fold the overhang under itself and pinch the sides to create a pleat.</li>
                    <li>Mix the egg yolk and cream together and brush onto the outside of the edges of the pie crust.</li>
                    <li> Place back into the fridge to chill while the oven preheats to 400 degrees.</li>
                    <li>Once the pie crust has chilled, score the dough with the bottom of a fork, line with parchment paper and fill to the brim with pie weights or dried beans.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, carefully remove the pie weights then place back into the oven to bake another 25-30 minutes, or until the crust has turned deep golden brown.</li>

                <h4><em>For The Filling:</em></h4>
                    <li>In a medium saucepan over medium heat, place in the heavy cream, pinot noir, brown sugar, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Slice open one side of the vanilla bean and remove the seeds with the back of the knife.</li>
                    <li>Add the vanilla beans to the cream along with the pod itself.</li>
                    <li>eat this mixture while stirring just until it starts to steam then remove from the heat. Add in the chocolate and let sit for 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Add in the butter and whisk the mixture vigorously until the chocolate has completely melted and a shiny, chocolate-y sauce appears.</li>
                    <li>Pour into the prepared pie crust, cover with plastic wrap so that the plastic touches the chocolate and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours.</li>

                </ol>
